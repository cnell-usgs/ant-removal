### QUESTIONS  

**Time, thermal differences** among species  
- Is discovery time and recruitment time shorter for the Argentine ant than for the natives?  

**Competitive ability**  
- Does the Argentine ant find faster the bait when is not competing with other ants? And the native species when they’re not competing against de Argentine?   
- Do native species find faster the bait when they’re not competing with the Argentine ant?  
  
**Recruitment strategy**  
- Which species has the most numerous recruitment? And the fastest discovery time?  
- Is always the Argentine ant the one who colonized the baits when there’s no removal or some species colonize it better?  
- Does the Argentine ant displace other species when they’re competing? Or any of the native species displaces the Argentine ant?

## Approach    

Pairwise comparisons of each ant species against the Argentine ant. Performance with removal vs competing.    
Binary variables - did Argentine win?  

```{r}
list.files('data')
ants<-read.csv('data/antcookie_sp_raw.csv')%>%mutate(FLAG_ID = paste0(NATIVE_SP,'_', FLAG))

antnew<-read.csv('data/ANT_NEW.csv')%>%mutate(FLAG_ID = paste0(FLAG_NATIVE,'_', FLAG))

str(antnew)

```  
Flag is the unit. For each flag, removals occurred 2 days preceeding competition. Some flags had multiple native species, treat flag x native as unit, so use FLAG_ID as the replicate for the experiment (n = 19).


For each FLAG_ID, calculate the difference in performance between  
native and invasive ant species  
for both with and without competition  
```{r}
antmelt<-antnew%>%
  melt(id.vars=c('PLOT','FLAG','FLAG_ID','FLAG_NATIVE','ANT_SP','COMPETE','COMPETE_TRUE','COMPETE_DISPLACE','COMPETE_TIME','COMPETE_TEMP'))#%>%
  mutate(COMPETE = ifelse(COMPETE_TRUE =='Y','Y','N')) # not competing if other ant does not show up
#cleaning COMPETE won't work in dcsat -uses length - would want the mean in that case

antcast<-antmelt%>%dplyr::select(-COMPETE_TRUE)%>%
  dcast(PLOT+FLAG+FLAG_ID+FLAG_NATIVE+ANT_SP+variable~COMPETE)


```
```{r}
#cast by compete 
ants%>%dplyr::select(-DAY)%>%melt(id.vars=c('NATIVE_SP','PLOT','FLAG','FLAG_ID','REMOVAL'))

antz<-ants%>%dplyr::select(PLOT, FLAG_ID, COMPETE, ANT_SP,TIME_COMPETE:ANT_MAX)%>%
  melt(id.vars=c('PLOT','FLAG_ID','COMPETE','ANT_SP'), variable.name='metric', value.name='metric_val')%>%
  filter(!is.na(metric_val))%>%mutate(ORIGIN=ifelse(ANT_SP=='LH','invasive','native'))

anty<-antz%>%dcast(PLOT+FLAG_ID+COMPETE+metric~ORIGIN, value.var='ANT_SP')


```
