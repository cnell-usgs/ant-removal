### QUESTIONS  

**Time, thermal differences** among species  
- Is discovery time and recruitment time shorter for the Argentine ant than for the natives?  

**Competitive ability**  
- Does the Argentine ant find faster the bait when is not competing with other ants? And the native species when they’re not competing against de Argentine?   
- Do native species find faster the bait when they’re not competing with the Argentine ant?  
  
**Recruitment strategy**  
- Which species has the most numerous recruitment? And the fastest discovery time?  
- Is always the Argentine ant the one who colonized the baits when there’s no removal or some species colonize it better?  
- Does the Argentine ant displace other species when they’re competing? Or any of the native species displaces the Argentine ant?  

#################
## Approach    

Pairwise comparisons of each ant species against the Argentine ant. Performance with removal vs competing.    
Binary variables - did Argentine win?  

```{r}
ants<-read.csv('data/antcookie_sp_raw.csv')
